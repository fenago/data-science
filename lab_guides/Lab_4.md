LabÂ 4. Multiclass Classification with RandomForest
==============================================



Overview

This lab will show you how to train a multiclass classifier using
the Random Forest algorithm. You will also see how to evaluate the
performance of multiclass models.

By the end of the lab, you will be able to implement a Random Forest
classifier, as well as tune hyperparameters in order to improve model
performance.




Training a Random Forest Classifier
===================================



Let\'s see how we can train a Random Forest classifier on this dataset.
First, we need to load the data from the GitHub repository using
`pandas` and then we will print its first five rows using the
`head()` method.



```
import pandas as pd
file_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago'\
           '/data-science/master/Lab04/'\
           'Dataset/activity.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(file_url)
df.head()
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_01.jpg)

Caption: First five rows of the dataset

Each row represents an activity that was performed by a person and the
name of the activity is stored in the `Activity` column. There
are seven different activities in this variable: `bending1`,
`bending2`, `cycling`, `lying`,
`sitting`, `standing`, and `Walking`. The
other six columns are different measurements taken from sensor data.

In this example, you will accurately predict the target variable
(`'Activity'`) from the features (the six other columns) using
Random Forest. For example, for the first row of the preceding example,
the model will receive the following features as input and will predict
the `'bending1'` class:

![](./images/B15019_04_02.jpg)

Caption: Features for the first row of the dataset

But before that, we need to do a bit of data preparation. The
`sklearn` package (we will use it to train Random Forest
model) requires the target variable and the features to be separated.
So, we need to extract the response variable using the
`.pop()` method from `pandas`. The
`.pop()` method extracts the specified column and removes it
from the DataFrame:

```
target = df.pop('Activity')
```


The `sklearn` package provides a function called
`train_test_split()` to randomly split the dataset into two
different sets. We need to specify the following parameters for this
function: the feature and target variables, the ratio of the testing set
(`test_size`), and `random_state` in order to get
reproducible results if we have to run the code again:

```
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split\
                                   (df, target, test_size=0.33, \
                                    random_state=42)
```


Now that we have got our training and testing sets, we are ready for
modeling. Let\'s first import the `RandomForestClassifier`
class from `sklearn.ensemble`:

```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
```

This topic will be covered more in depth in *Lab 8, Hyperparameter Tuning*. For now, we will just specify the
`random_state` value. We will walk you through some of the key
hyperparameters in the following sections:


```
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                  n_estimators=10)
```

The next step is to train (also called fit) the model with the training
data. During this step, the model will try to learn the relationship
between the response variable and the independent variables and save the
parameters learned. We need to specify the features and target variables
as parameters:

```
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_03.jpg)

Caption: Logs of the trained RandomForest

Now that the model has completed its training, we can use the parameters
it learned to make predictions on the input data we will provide. In the
following example, we are using the features from the training set:

```
preds = rf_model.predict(X_train)
```
Now we can print these predictions:

```
preds
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_04.jpg)


Evaluating the Model\'s Performance
===================================


If your model made 950 correct predictions out of 1,000
cases, then the accuracy score would be 950/1000 = 0.95. This would mean
that your model was 95% accurate on that dataset. The
`sklearn` package provides a function to calculate this score
automatically and it is called `accuracy_score()`. We need to
import it first:

```
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
```

Then, we just need to provide the list of predictions for some
observations and the corresponding true value for the target variable.
Using the previous example, we will use the `y_train` and
`preds` variables, which respectively contain the response
variable (also known as the target) for the training set and the
corresponding predictions made by the Random Forest model. We will reuse
the predictions from the previous section -- `preds`:

```
accuracy_score(y_train, preds)
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_06.jpg)



Let\'s calculate the accuracy score for the testing set:

```
test_preds = rf_model.predict(X_test)
accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds)
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_07.jpg)



Exercise 4.01: Building a Model for Classifying Animal Type and Assessing Its Performance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, we will train a Random Forest classifier to predict
the type of an animal based on its attributes and check its accuracy
score:


1.  Open a new Jupyter notebook.

2.  Import the `pandas` package:
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    ```


3.  Create a variable called `file_url` that contains the URL
    of the dataset:
    ```
    file_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com'\
               '/fenago/data-science'\
               '/master/Lab04/Dataset'\
               '/openml_phpZNNasq.csv'
    ```


4.  Load the dataset into a DataFrame using the `.read_csv()`
    method from pandas:
    ```
    df = pd.read_csv(file_url)
    ```


5.  Print the first five rows of the DataFrame:

    ```
    df.head()
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_08.jpg)


    Caption: First five rows of the DataFrame

    We will be using the `type` column as our target variable.
    We will need to remove the `animal` column from the
    DataFrame and only use the remaining columns as features.

6.  Remove the `'animal'` column using the `.drop()`
    method from `pandas` and specify the
    `columns='animal'` and `inplace=True` parameters
    (to directly update the original DataFrame):
    ```
    df.drop(columns='animal', inplace=True)
    ```


7.  Extract the `'type'` column using the `.pop()`
    method from `pandas`:
    ```
    y = df.pop('type')
    ```


8.  Print the first five rows of the updated DataFrame:

    ```
    df.head()
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_09.jpg)


    Caption: First five rows of the DataFrame

9.  Import the `train_test_split` function from
    `sklearn.model_selection`:
    ```
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    ```


10. Split the dataset into training and testing sets with the
    `df`, `y`, `test_size=0.4`, and
    `random_state=188` parameters:
    ```
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split\
                                       (df, y, test_size=0.4, \
                                        random_state=188)
    ```


11. Import `RandomForestClassifier` from
    `sklearn.ensemble`:
    ```
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    ```


12. Instantiate the `RandomForestClassifier` object with
    `random_state` equal to `42`. Set the
    `n-estimators` value to an initial default value of
    `10`. We\'ll discuss later how changing this value affects
    the result.
    ```
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, \
                                      n_estimators=10)
    ```


13. Fit `RandomForestClassifier` with the training set:

    ```
    rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_10.jpg)


    Caption: Logs of RandomForestClassifier

14. Predict the outcome of the training set with the
    `.predict()`method, save the results in a variable called
    \'`train_preds`\', and print its value:

    ```
    train_preds = rf_model.predict(X_train)
    train_preds
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_11.jpg)


    Caption: Predictions on the training set

15. Import the `accuracy_score` function from
    `sklearn.metrics`:
    ```
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    ```


16. Calculate the accuracy score on the training set, save the result in
    a variable called `train_acc`, and print its value:

    ```
    train_acc = accuracy_score(y_train, train_preds)
    print(train_acc)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_12.jpg)


    Caption: Accuracy score on the training set


17. Predict the outcome of the testing set with the
    `.predict()` method and save the results into a variable
    called `test_preds`:
    ```
    test_preds = rf_model.predict(X_test)
    ```


18. Calculate the accuracy score on the testing set, save the result in
    a variable called `test_acc`, and print its value:

    ```
    test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds)
    print(test_acc)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_13.jpg)





You can find out which version you are using by executing the following code:

`import sklearn`

`sklearn.__version__`



In general, the higher the number of trees is, the better the
performance you will get. Let\'s see what happens with
`n_estimators = 2` on the Activity Recognition dataset:

```
rf_model2 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                   n_estimators=2)
rf_model2.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds2 = rf_model2.predict(X_train)
test_preds2 = rf_model2.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds2))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds2))
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_16.jpg)

Caption: Accuracy of RandomForest with n\_estimators = 2

As expected, the accuracy is significantly lower than the previous
example with `n_estimators = 10`. Let\'s now try with
`50` trees:

```
rf_model3 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                   n_estimators=50)
rf_model3.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds3 = rf_model3.predict(X_train)
test_preds3 = rf_model3.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds3))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds3))
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_17.jpg)

Caption: Accuracy of RandomForest with n\_estimators = 50



Exercise 4.02: Tuning n\_estimators to Reduce Overfitting
---------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, we will train a Random Forest classifier to predict
the type of an animal based on its attributes and will try two different
values for the `n_estimators` hyperparameter:

We will be using the same zoo dataset as in the previous exercise.

1.  Open a new Jupyter notebook.

2.  Import the `pandas `package, `train_test_split`,
    `RandomForestClassifier`, and `accuracy_score`
    from `sklearn`:
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    ```


3.  Create a variable called `file_url` that contains the URL
    to the dataset:
    ```
    file_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com'\
               '/fenago/data-science'\
               '/master/Lab04/Dataset'\
               '/openml_phpZNNasq.csv'
    ```


4.  Load the dataset into a DataFrame using the `.read_csv()`
    method from `pandas`:
    ```
    df = pd.read_csv(file_url)
    ```


5.  Remove the `animal` column using `.drop()` and
    then extract the `type` target variable into a new
    variable called `y` using `.pop()`:
    ```
    df.drop(columns='animal', inplace=True)
    y = df.pop('type')
    ```


6.  Split the data into training and testing sets with
    `train_test_split()` and the `test_size=0.4` and
    `random_state=188` parameters:
    ```
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split\
                                       (df, y, test_size=0.4, \
                                        random_state=188)
    ```


7.  Instantiate `RandomForestClassifier` with
    `random_state=42` and `n_estimators=1`, and then
    fit the model with the training set:

    ```
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, \
                                      n_estimators=1)
    rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_18.jpg)


    Caption: Logs of RandomForestClassifier

8.  Make predictions on the training and testing sets with
    `.predict()` and save the results into two new variables
    called `train_preds` and `test_preds`:
    ```
    train_preds = rf_model.predict(X_train)
    test_preds = rf_model.predict(X_test)
    ```


9.  Calculate the accuracy score for the training and testing sets and
    save the results in two new variables called `train_acc`
    and `test_acc`:
    ```
    train_acc = accuracy_score(y_train, train_preds)
    test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds)
    ```


10. Print the accuracy scores: `train_acc` and
    `test_acc`:

    ```
    print(train_acc)
    print(test_acc)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_19.jpg)


    Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets

    The accuracy score decreased for both the training and testing sets.
    But now the difference is smaller compared to the results from
    *Exercise 4.01*, *Building a Model for Classifying Animal Type and
    Assessing Its Performance*.

11. Instantiate another `RandomForestClassifier` with
    `random_state=42` and `n_estimators=30`, and
    then fit the model with the training set:

    ```
    rf_model2 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, \
                                       n_estimators=30)
    rf_model2.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_20.jpg)


    Caption: Logs of RandomForest with n\_estimators = 30

12. Make predictions on the training and testing sets with
    `.predict()` and save the results into two new variables
    called `train_preds2` and `test_preds2`:
    ```
    train_preds2 = rf_model2.predict(X_train)
    test_preds2 = rf_model2.predict(X_test)
    ```


13. Calculate the accuracy score for the training and testing sets and
    save the results in two new variables called `train_acc2`
    and `test_acc2`:
    ```
    train_acc2 = accuracy_score(y_train, train_preds2)
    test_acc2 = accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds2)
    ```


14. Print the accuracy scores: `train_acc` and
    `test_acc`:

    ```
    print(train_acc2)
    print(test_acc2)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

Maximum Depth
=============


In the previous section, we learned how Random Forest builds multiple
trees to make predictions. Increasing the number of trees does improve
model performance but it usually doesn\'t help much to decrease the risk
of overfitting. Our model in the previous example is still performing
much better on the training set (data it has already seen) than on the
testing set (unseen data).

So, we are not confident enough yet to say the model will perform well
in production. There are different hyperparameters that can help to
lower the risk of overfitting for Random Forest and one of them is
called `max_depth`.

This hyperparameter defines the depth of the trees built by Random
Forest. Basically, it tells Random Forest model, how many nodes
(questions) it can create before making predictions. But how will that
help to reduce overfitting, you may ask. Well, let\'s say you built a
single tree and set the `max_depth` hyperparameter to
`50`. This would mean that there would be some cases where you
could ask 49 different questions (the value `c` includes the
final leaf node) before making a prediction. So, the logic would be
`IF X1 > value1 AND X2 > value2 AND X1 <= value3 AND â¦ AND X3 > value49 THEN predict class A`.

As you can imagine, this is a very specific rule. In the end, it may
apply to only a few observations in the training set, with this case
appearing very infrequently. Therefore, your model would be overfitting.
By default, the value of this `max_depth` parameter is
`None`, which means there is no limit set for the depth of the
trees.

What you really want is to find some rules that are generic enough to be
applied to bigger groups of observations. This is why it is recommended
to not create deep trees with Random Forest. Let\'s try several values
for this hyperparameter on the Activity Recognition dataset:
`3`, `10`, and `50`:

```
rf_model4 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                   n_estimators=50, max_depth=3)
rf_model4.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds4 = rf_model4.predict(X_train)
test_preds4 = rf_model4.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds4))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds4))
```

You should get the following output:

![Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets and a
max\_depth of 3 ](./images/B15019_04_22.jpg)

Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets and a
max\_depth of 3

For a `max_depth` of `3`, we got extremely similar
results for the training and testing sets but the overall performance
decreased drastically to `0.61`. Our model is not overfitting
anymore, but it is now underfitting; that is, it is not predicting the
target variable very well (only in `61%` of cases). Let\'s
increase `max_depth` to `10`:

```
rf_model5 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                   n_estimators=50, \
                                   max_depth=10)
rf_model5.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds5 = rf_model5.predict(X_train)
test_preds5 = rf_model5.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds5))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds5))
```
![Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets and a
max\_depth of 10 ](./images/B15019_04_23.jpg)

Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets and a
max\_depth of 10

The accuracy of the training set increased and is relatively close to
the testing set. We are starting to get some good results, but the model
is still slightly overfitting. Now we will see the results for
`max_depth = 50`:

```
rf_model6 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                   n_estimators=50, \
                                   max_depth=50)
rf_model6.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds6 = rf_model6.predict(X_train)
test_preds6 = rf_model6.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds6))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds6))
```

The output will be as follows:

![Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets and a
max\_depth of 50 ](./images/B15019_04_24.jpg)

Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets and a
max\_depth of 50

The accuracy jumped to `0.99` for the training set but it
didn\'t improve much for the testing set. So, the model is overfitting
with `max_depth = 50`. It seems the sweet spot to get good
predictions and not much overfitting is around `10` for the
`max_depth` hyperparameter in this dataset.



Exercise 4.03: Tuning max\_depth to Reduce Overfitting
------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, we will keep tuning our RandomForest classifier that
predicts animal type by trying two different values for the
`max_depth` hyperparameter:

We will be using the same zoo dataset as in the previous exercise.

1.  Open a new Jupyter notebook.

2.  Import the `pandas` package, `train_test_split`,
    `RandomForestClassifier`, and `accuracy_score`
    from `sklearn`:
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    ```


3.  Create a variable called `file_url` that contains the URL
    to the dataset:
    ```
    file_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com'\
               'fenago/data-science'\
               '/master/Lab04/Dataset'\
               '/openml_phpZNNasq.csv'
    ```


4.  Load the dataset into a DataFrame using the `.read_csv()`
    method from `pandas`:
    ```
    df = pd.read_csv(file_url)
    ```


5.  Remove the `animal` column using `.drop()` and
    then extract the `type` target variable into a new
    variable called `y` using `.pop()`:
    ```
    df.drop(columns='animal', inplace=True)
    y = df.pop('type')
    ```


6.  Split the data into training and testing sets with
    `train_test_split()` and the parameters
    `test_size=0.4` and `random_state=188`:
    ```
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split\
                                       (df, y, test_size=0.4, \
                                        random_state=188)
    ```


7.  Instantiate `RandomForestClassifier` with
    `random_state=42`, `n_estimators=30`, and
    `max_depth=5`, and then fit the model with the training
    set:

    ```
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, \
                                      n_estimators=30, \
                                      max_depth=5)
    rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_25.jpg)


    Caption: Logs of RandomForest

8.  Make predictions on the training and testing sets with
    `.predict()` and save the results into two new variables
    called `train_preds` and `test_preds`:
    ```
    train_preds = rf_model.predict(X_train)
    test_preds = rf_model.predict(X_test)
    ```


9.  Calculate the accuracy score for the training and testing sets and
    save the results in two new variables called `train_acc`
    and `test_acc`:
    ```
    train_acc = accuracy_score(y_train, train_preds)
    test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds)
    ```


10. Print the accuracy scores: `train_acc` and
    `test_acc`:

    ```
    print(train_acc)
    print(test_acc)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets

    We got the exact same accuracy scores as for the best result we
    obtained in the previous exercise. This value for the
    `max_depth` hyperparameter hasn\'t impacted the model\'s
    performance.

11. Instantiate another `RandomForestClassifier` with
    `random_state=42`, `n_estimators=30`, and
    `max_depth=2`, and then fit the model with the training
    set:

    ```
    rf_model2 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, \
                                       n_estimators=30, \
                                       max_depth=2)
    rf_model2.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_27.jpg)

12. Make predictions on the training and testing sets with
    `.predict()` and save the results into two new variables
    called `train_preds2 `and `test_preds2`:
    ```
    train_preds2 = rf_model2.predict(X_train)
    test_preds2 = rf_model2.predict(X_test)
    ```


13. Calculate the accuracy scores for the training and testing sets and
    save the results in two new variables called `train_acc2`
    and `test_acc2`:
    ```
    train_acc2 = accuracy_score(y_train, train_preds2)
    test_acc2 = accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds2)
    ```


14. Print the accuracy scores: `train_acc` and
    `test_acc`:

    ```
    print(train_acc2)
    print(test_acc2)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

Minimum Sample in Leaf
======================


It would be great if we could let the model know to not create such
specific rules that happen quite infrequently. Luckily,
`RandomForest` has such a hyperparameter and, you guessed it,
it is `min_samples_leaf`. This hyperparameter will specify the
minimum number of observations (or samples) that will have to fall under
a leaf node to be considered in the tree. For instance, if we set
`min_samples_leaf` to `3`, then
`RandomForest` will only consider a split that leads to at
least three observations on both the left and right leaf nodes. If this
condition is not met for a split, the model will not consider it and
will exclude it from the tree. The default value in `sklearn`
for this hyperparameter is `1`. Let\'s try to find the optimal
value for `min_samples_leaf` for the Activity Recognition
dataset:

```
rf_model7 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                   n_estimators=50, \
                                   max_depth=10, \
                                   min_samples_leaf=3)
rf_model7.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds7 = rf_model7.predict(X_train)
test_preds7 = rf_model7.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds7))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds7))
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_29.jpg)

Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets for
min\_samples\_leaf=3

With `min_samples_leaf=3`, the accuracy for both the training
and testing sets didn\'t change much compared to the best model we found
in the previous section. Let\'s try increasing it to `10`:

```
rf_model8 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                   n_estimators=50, \
                                   max_depth=10, \
                                   min_samples_leaf=10)
rf_model8.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds8 = rf_model8.predict(X_train)
test_preds8 = rf_model8.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds8))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds8))
```

The output will be as follows:

![Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets for
min\_samples\_leaf=10 ](./images/B15019_04_30.jpg)

Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets for
min\_samples\_leaf=10

Now the accuracy of the training set dropped a bit but increased for the
testing set and their difference is smaller now. So, our model is
overfitting less. Let\'s try another value for this hyperparameter --
`25`:

```
rf_model9 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                   n_estimators=50, \
                                   max_depth=10, \
                                   min_samples_leaf=25)
rf_model9.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds9 = rf_model9.predict(X_train)
test_preds9 = rf_model9.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds9))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds9))
```

The output will be as follows:

![](./images/B15019_04_31.jpg)




Exercise 4.04: Tuning min\_samples\_leaf
----------------------------------------

In this exercise, we will keep tuning our Random Forest classifier that
predicts animal type by trying two different values for the
`min_samples_leaf` hyperparameter:

We will be using the same zoo dataset as in the previous exercise.

1.  Open a new Jupyter notebook.

2.  Import the `pandas` package, `train_test_split`,
    `RandomForestClassifier`, and `accuracy_score`
    from `sklearn`:
    ```
    import pandas as pd
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
    ```


3.  Create a variable called `file_url` that contains the URL
    to the dataset:
    ```
    file_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com'\
               '/fenago/data-science'\
               '/master/Lab04/Dataset/openml_phpZNNasq.csv'
    ```


4.  Load the dataset into a DataFrame using the `.read_csv()`
    method from `pandas`:
    ```
    df = pd.read_csv(file_url)
    ```


5.  Remove the `animal` column using `.drop()` and
    then extract the `type` target variable into a new
    variable called `y` using `.pop()`:
    ```
    df.drop(columns='animal', inplace=True)
    y = df.pop('type')
    ```


6.  Split the data into training and testing sets with
    `train_test_split()` and the parameters
    `test_size=0.4` and `random_state=188`:
    ```
    X_train, X_test, \
    y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df, y, test_size=0.4, \
                                       random_state=188)
    ```


7.  Instantiate `RandomForestClassifier` with
    `random_state=42`, `n_estimators=30`,
    `max_depth=2`, and `min_samples_leaf=3`, and
    then fit the model with the training set:

    ```
    rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, \
                                      n_estimators=30, \
                                      max_depth=2, \
                                      min_samples_leaf=3)
    rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_32.jpg)


    Caption: Logs of RandomForest

8.  Make predictions on the training and testing sets with
    `.predict()` and save the results into two new variables
    called `train_preds` and `test_preds`:
    ```
    train_preds = rf_model.predict(X_train)
    test_preds = rf_model.predict(X_test)
    ```


9.  Calculate the accuracy score for the training and testing sets and
    save the results in two new variables called `train_acc`
    and `test_acc`:
    ```
    train_acc = accuracy_score(y_train, train_preds)
    test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds)
    ```


10. Print the accuracy score -- `train_acc` and
    `test_acc`:

    ```
    print(train_acc)
    print(test_acc)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_33.jpg)


11. Instantiate another `RandomForestClassifier` with
    `random_state=42`, `n_estimators=30`,
    `max_depth=2`, and `min_samples_leaf=7`, and
    then fit the model with the training set:

    ```
    rf_model2 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42, \
                                       n_estimators=30, \
                                       max_depth=2, \
                                       min_samples_leaf=7)
    rf_model2.fit(X_train, y_train)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_34.jpg)


    Caption: Logs of RandomForest with max\_depth=2

    test_preds2 = rf_model2.predict(X_test)
    ```

    and `test_acc2`:
    ```
    train_acc2 = accuracy_score(y_train, train_preds2)
    test_acc2 = accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds2)
    ```


14. Print the accuracy scores: `train_acc` and
    `test_acc`:

    ```
    print(train_acc2)
    print(test_acc2)
    ```


    You should get the following output:

    
![](./images/B15019_04_35.jpg)




Maximum Features
================


Let\'s try three different values on the activity dataset. First, we
will specify the maximum number of features as two:

```
rf_model10 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                    n_estimators=50, \
                                    max_depth=10, \
                                    min_samples_leaf=25, \
                                    max_features=2)
rf_model10.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds10 = rf_model10.predict(X_train)
test_preds10 = rf_model10.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds10))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds10))
```

The output will be as follows:

![Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets for
max\_features=2 ](./images/B15019_04_36.jpg)

Caption: Accuracy scores for the training and testing sets for
max\_features=2

We got results similar to those of the best model we trained in the
previous section. This is not really surprising as we were using the
default value of `max_features` at that time, which is
`sqrt`. The square root of `2` equals
`1.45`, which is quite close to `2`. This time,
let\'s try with the ratio `0.7`:

```
rf_model11 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                    n_estimators=50, \
                                    max_depth=10, \
                                    min_samples_leaf=25, \
                                    max_features=0.7)
rf_model11.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds11 = rf_model11.predict(X_train)
test_preds11 = rf_model11.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds11))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds11))
```

The output will be as follows:

![ ](./images/B15019_04_37.jpg)

With this ratio, both accuracy scores increased for the training and
testing sets and the difference between them is less. Our model is
overfitting less now and has slightly improved its predictive power.
Let\'s give it a shot with the `log2` option:

```
rf_model12 = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=1, \
                                    n_estimators=50, \
                                    max_depth=10, \
                                    min_samples_leaf=25, \
                                    max_features='log2')
rf_model12.fit(X_train, y_train)
preds12 = rf_model12.predict(X_train)
test_preds12 = rf_model12.predict(X_test)
print(accuracy_score(y_train, preds12))
print(accuracy_score(y_test, test_preds12))
```

The output will be as follows:

Activity 4.01: Train a Random Forest Classifier on the ISOLET Dataset
---------------------------------------------------------------------

You are working for a technology company and they are planning to launch
a new voice assistant product. You have been tasked with building a
classification model that will recognize the letters spelled out by a
user based on the signal frequencies captured. Each sound can be
captured and represented as a signal composed of multiple frequencies.


The following steps will help you to complete this activity:

1.  Download and load the dataset using `.read_csv()` from
    `pandas`.
2.  Extract the response variable using `.pop()` from
    `pandas`.
3.  Split the dataset into training and test sets using
    `train_test_split()` from
    `sklearn.model_selection`.
4.  Create a function that will instantiate and fit a
    `RandomForestClassifier` using `.fit()` from
    `sklearn.ensemble`.
5.  Create a function that will predict the outcome for the training and
    testing sets using `.predict()`.
6.  Create a function that will print the accuracy score for the
    training and testing sets using `accuracy_score()` from
    `sklearn.metrics`.
7.  Train and get the accuracy score for a range of different
    hyperparameters. Here are some options you can try:
    - `n_estimators = 20` and `50`
    - `max_depth = 5` and `10`
    - `min_samples_leaf = 10` and `50`
    - `max_features = 0.5` and `0.3`
8.  Select the best hyperparameter value.

These are the accuracy scores for the best model we trained:

Summary
=======


We have finally reached the end of this lab on multiclass
classification with Random Forest. We learned that multiclass
classification is an extension of binary classification: instead of
predicting only two classes, target variables can have many more values.
We saw how we can train a Random Forest model in just a few lines of
code and assess its performance by calculating the accuracy score for
the training and testing sets. Finally, we learned how to tune some of
its most important hyperparameters: `n_estimators`,
`max_depth`, `min_samples_leaf`, and
`max_features`. We also saw how their values can have a
significant impact on the predictive power of a model but also on its
ability to generalize to unseen data.
